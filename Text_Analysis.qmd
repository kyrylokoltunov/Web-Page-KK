My mini project examines Google reviews for one of my favorite places to dine in Northfield, MN, The Ole Store Restaurant. Known for its Norwegian and European cuisine, this spot holds a special place in the community. With over 800 Google reviews, it provides a strong dataset for meaningful text analysis. The goal of this project is to explore the psychology of customer feedback, understand trends in both positive and negative reviews, and highlight linguistic patterns in user-generated comments.

Scatterplot Analysis
---

**📌 Insert scatterplot image here**

The first scatterplot shows that the longest reviews were mostly written for **5-star ratings**, while reviews with 4, 3, 2, or 1 stars tended to be shorter or even empty. Many 1-star reviews consisted of only a few words or no text at all.

Positive reviews tend to be longer because people are more inclined to describe enjoyable experiences. Negative reviewers often use minimal effort—unless a situation was extremely upsetting, in which case the text becomes much longer (e.g., a 600-character 1-star outlier).

Contain fewer adjectives and more neutral nouns. Themes mention slow service, overcooked dishes, and mixed experiences.

### **1-Star Reviews**
